# UFOs The Truth is Out There

This project is about presenting a webpage where you can search for UFOs encounters around US

## Overview

We created a web that includes a table presenting detailed information about UFOs encounters, using Bootstrap to create it

## Results

Here we can see the final result of our web page, where you can browse for specific events using the filter search in the left, as seen in the image above

## Summary

As we can see there are many things to improve for our web page:

1- First it would be perfect to show live data, so we can search for UFOs encounters as it happens, and visualize it on a map 

2- Second I think that its better to have presented the option of cities as they are, instead of texting them ourselves.

Those could be major improvements to this project
